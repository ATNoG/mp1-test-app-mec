# Mp1 Test App MEC

 - A simple web application to test the implementation of the ETSI's Mp1 MEC interface, referenced in the document [MEC011](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/MEC/001_099/011/02.02.01_60/gs_MEC011v020201p.pdf).

## Usage

 - Our intention with this test App is to showcase the functionalities of our MEP implementation, provided in the repository [netedge-mep](https://github.com/ATNoG/netedge-mep).


## Consideration

 - This App heavily reused the code provided by the [Unibo MEC API Tester](https://github.com/berdav/unibo-test-mec), but modified it to work with our implementation of the Mp1 interface.
